This data set is retrieved from the North Temperate Lakes LTER. The data represents annual fish assemblages in eleven different lakes at six littoral zone sites per lake. Measurement years range from 1981 - 2022. This analysis primarily focuses on the weight and length data collected from trout perch in all sample years.

The code for this document can be found in the "code" folder, and the original data set in the "data" folder. It can also be found on my git hub account [here](https://github.com/katelyn-rose/ENVS-193DS_homework-04_miller-katie/tree/main).
